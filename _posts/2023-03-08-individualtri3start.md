started developing real functionality for admin backend page. the rest of the admin page was built off of the progress made in this one commit

[frontend update method](https://github.com/Codemaxxers/codemaxxerFrontend/commit/44830072a7353a240ec374519baab169557348e6)

here I began implementing my CRUD functionality into the frontend. 

# Project progress

My main progress was focused on CRUD functionality for users. I spent most time on this functionality in a backend part of our project but I 
did start spending some time getting the CRUD functionality to work in the frontend as well, though I ran into a problem that took up a lot of time.

# key success from last trimester

I was able to get username to successfully change with frontend input, but I keep running into a big problem which I discovered via debugging.
Changing your email while you are logged in as that user breaks the backend, which I can't seem to pin down. I did find a part of the code that is causing this
break to occur, but I am still trying to find solution. This might not even be worth fixing, but I would like to fix this if possible.
