[issue 1](https://github.com/y2kcoders/backend/issues/1)
[issue 2](https://github.com/y2kcoders/skatepark.co/issues/10)

theres nothing too remarkable about these issues. I just fixed a problem in each of them, but they were pretty time-consuming problems that I had to constantly log within to ensure I was actually making progress.

- GitHub commits for first half of the year

I have commits for most days.

- Something you are passionate about in the upcoming project

Working with google bard might make me less spoiled because I've been messing with claude for a while and that ai is op for my uses but I really need to branch out a bit. I might be able to do some testing with it. 

Also I can make sure my team doesn't lose their keys because I know way more about stealing keys now than I should

- Anything else you want to talk about

I have to admit I'm looking into key scraping because I want to use aws claude without paying for it, but I can't find a lot of information, only loose leads on forums. 

places i've looked:

[trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) inefficient key scraper, limited to s3 buckets and github.

replit might have some keys but i'll likely need a bot for this.

someone mentioned censys, what is that?
