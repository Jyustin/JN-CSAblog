# Two Trimester focus planning

how you used N@tM to capture test data to be used in trimester 3
from feedback, something you will add to your project
other?

From the demos from Night at the museum my biggest thing to work on is making accounts actually worthwhile. Theres very little you can do with an account and other than some crud functionality theres literally nothing interesting. We had to focus on our gamey parts of our project then, as no one was interesting in editing accounts.

## IDEAS

build a community around users, like a chatboard maybe or something that makes you want to make an account to further participate in our project and the 
culture built around it. 

go back to the social media implementation idea. although I couldn't build this in time, I really think it would be cool to add some functionality with social media platforms. Would also make accounts far more viable.

Make some more data that accounts can save. Like allowing users to save a biography on their account page. idk anything could help at this point.

# what to work on 

We were very charismatic and we were able to bring people into our project with our really nice css and visually appealing games. We also were able to accurately show off our project without stumbling into errors. We could have done better on the technical side, as we didn't really talk about the "behind the scenes" material and how this was made. 

I also feel like the weakness in technicals was also because there wasn't anything too interesting going on in the technical side, but I already covered that in ideas so feedback here is redundant.

# Blog on event

I still saw some cool things that impressed me, despite having already been to a couple in the past. Every club was impressive as always, though I still think the best parts of N@TM are the music program performances. Its too bad there were not any this time but I still had fun looking at other club's creations. I think I was most impressed by pottery because its so disconnected from anything i've ever done before. 3d animation and photography are things i've seen and even worked a bit in before, but I have never touched upon physical art like pottery or drawings before.

I was pretty intrigued by the ML team with stock ai. I think James was on the team but I thought the Machine Learning was cool and was very ambitious. I respect their project quite a lot and I think they could have been the most technically impressive project there.

I also saw a project built around a game where you style a button. i think it was csse or csp but I liked the creativity of the project and how they took a simple idea and made it into something that is admittedly a cool idea although their css was pretty simple.
