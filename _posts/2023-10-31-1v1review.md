- Blog showing your key assets and projects

- [tri 1 project](https://github.com/y2kcoders/skatepark.co)
- [sorting project](https://github.com/TheoH32/jtf-blog)
- [timebox](https://jyustin.github.io/JN-CSAblog/AD_compsci.html)

timebox has all resources I realistically need, but I need to organize it better. 

- College Board prep and assets

- [timebox](https://jyustin.github.io/JN-CSAblog/AD_compsci.html) I'm using lessons made by others to store my notes. 

- Blog timebox / Key Issues and other organization showing how you know where you have been and where you are going 

[timebox](https://jyustin.github.io/JN-CSAblog/AD_compsci.html). Also stores all of my work I've done so far. 

[issue 1](https://github.com/y2kcoders/backend/issues/1)
[issue 2](https://github.com/y2kcoders/skatepark.co/issues/10)

theres nothing too remarkable about these issues. I just fixed a problem in each of them, but they were pretty time-consuming problems that I had to constantly log within to ensure I was actually making progress.

- GitHub commits for first half of the year

I have commits for most days.

- Something you are passionate about in the upcoming project

Working with google bard might make me less spoiled because I've been messing with claude for a while and that ai is op for my uses but I really need to branch out a bit. I might be able to do some testing with it. 

Though finn says the bard api is a bit backwards to access first, so If I can get some other api access through scraped keys that would be nice. gpt turbo keys should be easy to scrape, but aws keys would be way harder to access.

Also I can make sure my team doesn't lose their keys because I know way more about stealing keys now than I should

- Anything else you want to talk about

I have to admit I'm looking into key scraping because I want to use aws claude without paying for it, but I can't find a lot of information, only loose leads on forums. 

places i've looked:

[trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) inefficient key scraper, limited to s3 buckets and github.

replit might have some keys but i'll likely need a bot for this.

someone mentioned censys, what is that?
